OpenSCAD Balsa Chopper
=============

Get yourself some 1/2" by 1/2" extruded aluminum C angle for the handle, some skate bearings, some screws and nuts, then print out the hinges, the pivot point, and the blade holder. Mount that all to a nice solid board and you've got yourself a sweet balsa wood spar cutter.
